### Hello! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Marek and I'm an IT Solution Architect and Product Owner.

I caught the IT "bug" aged 12 when my Dad brought home one of the first Acorn Atoms. I've now been working professionally in the IT industry for more than 30 years (starting when mainframes were just about still going strong) and I've stuck to the "Technical" career paths for the most part.

I work for Fujitsu here in the UK and am currently in a hybrid role that's mixing a bit of solution architecture with a lot of product owner and pieces of product manager thrown in for good measure. Which means I have a lot to do and a lot to learn :smile:!

I'm here on GitHub because it's where I keep my online repo's for the software I write to try to get my Raspberry Pis to do interesting things[^1] (well, I think they're interesting :wink: ...). And I use GitHub Issues and Projects[^2] to manage my hobby projects. My Python skills are gradually improving (but a long way to go still) and I've been exploring Docker, InfluxDB and Redis too. Most of my repo's here are private - maybe one day I'll be brave enough to make some of them public and be even braver still to volunteer to contribute to other projects.

My profile picture - in case you're curious - is of me watching my footing on a walk in the Goyt Valley, not too far from where I live.

[^1]: Such as a Weather Station (a Pi Zero strapped to an outside wall with Enviro sensors and reporting back temperature, pressure etc. and a Flask app running on another Pi to show current readings and graphs of readings over the last few weeks), a Pi Monitor to check all my Pis are happy (with a dashboard on a little oled display by my desk) and a GrowHAT for some houseplants that checks moisture levels and with little pumps to do some automatic watering. And another little Flask app that uses Delia Smith's beef joint cooking instructions to give me the timings and oven temperatures for a perfectly cooked joint at the desired time.

[^2]: I **really** like the new GitHub Projects; I think they've done a super job there and am looking forward to seeing how it develops. I use Jira and Azure DevOps too (professionally) but using GitHub Projects for my personal projects is both a no-brainer and a joy.
