### Hello! 👋  I'm Marek and I'm an IT Solution Architect and Product "Own-ager".

I've been in the IT industry for more than 30 years, starting when mainframes were still going strong, and I've stuck to the "Technical" career paths for the most part.

I work for Fujitsu here in the UK and am currently in a hybrid role that's mixing a bit of solution architecture with a lot of product owner and pieces of product manager thrown in for good measure. Which means I have a lot to do and a lot to learn :smile:!

I'm here on GitHub because it's where I keep my online repo's for the software I write to try to get my Raspberry Pis to do interesting things (well, I think they're interesting :wink: ...). And I use GitHub Issues and Projects[^1] to manage my hobby projects. My Python skills are gradually improving (but a long way to go still) and I've been exploring Docker, InfluxDB and Redis too. Most of my repo's here are private - maybe one day I'll be brave enough to make some of them public and be even braver still to volunteer to contribute to other projects.

[^1]: I **really** like the new GitHub Projects; I think they've done a super job there and am looking forward to seeing how it develops. I use Jira and Azure DevOps too (professionally) but using GitHub Projects for my personal projects is both a no-brainer and a joy.
